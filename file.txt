When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night 
he’d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. 
Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before. 
Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world. 
His hand rose and fell softly with each precious breath. 
He pushed away the plastic tarpaulin and raised himself in 
the stinking robes and blankets and looked toward the east 
for any light but there was none.
